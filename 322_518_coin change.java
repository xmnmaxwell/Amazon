find fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount, can use repeatedly
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
use DP, O(amount*n) + O(amount) n, how many iterations
In the worst case the recursive tree of the algorithm has height of SS and the algorithm solves only SS subproblems 
because it caches precalculated solutions in a table. Each subproblem is computed with nn iterations, one by coin denomination.

public class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int max = amount + 1;             
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];  
        Arrays.fill(dp, max);  
        dp[0] = 0;   
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                if (coins[j] <= i) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }

518. compute the number of combinations that make up that amount.
O(mn)+O(mn)
dp[i][j] : the number of combinations to make up amount j by using the first i types of coins
State transition:

not using the ith coin, only using the first i-1 coins to make up amount j, then we have dp[i-1][j] ways.
using the ith coin, since we can use unlimited same coin, we need to know how many ways to make up amount j - coins[i-1] by using first i coins(including ith), which is dp[i][j-coins[i-1]]
Initialization: dp[i][0] = 1

Once you figure out all these, it's easy to write out the code:

    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[][] dp = new int[coins.length+1][amount+1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= coins.length; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (j >= coins[i-1] ? dp[i][j-coins[i-1]] : 0);
            }
        }
        return dp[coins.length][amount];
    }
