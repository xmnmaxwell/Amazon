62.A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?

        Integer[][] map = new Integer[m][n];

                map[i][j] = map[i-1][j]+map[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return map[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
/*The assumptions are
When (n==0||m==0) the function always returns 1 since the robot
can't go left or up.
For all other cells. The result = uniquePaths(m-1,n)+uniquePaths(m,n-1)
Therefore I populated the edges with 1 first and use DP to get the full 2-D array.

Please give any suggestions on improving the code.*/
